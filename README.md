# Nischint - Financial Personality Assessment

A modern web application that provides personalized financial assessments through an adaptive questionnaire system. The application analyzes user responses to create comprehensive financial profiles and insights.

## Overview

Nischint combines foundational questions with dynamically generated follow-up questions to create a personalized financial assessment experience. The application analyzes user responses and provides tailored insights powered by advanced language processing.

## Features

- **Adaptive Question System**: 5 foundational questions + 20 dynamically generated personalized questions
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses advanced language processing to generate contextual questions and summaries
- **Session Management**: Tracks user progress across question batches
- **Fallback System**: Continues working even if external services are unavailable
- **Modern Interface**: Clean design with dark/light theme support and smooth animations
- **Resizable Interface**: Fully resizable components for optimal user experience
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript for robust development

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19.2.0** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **jsPDF** for report generation

### External Services
- **Google Gemini** for question generation and analysis
- **React Markdown** for content rendering

## Quick Start
